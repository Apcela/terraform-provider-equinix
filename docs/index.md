# Equinix Provider

The Equinix provider is used to interact with the resources provided by Equinix Platform.
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before
it can be used.

For information about obtaining API key and secret refer to
[Generating Client ID and Client Secret key](https://developer.equinix.com/docs/ecx-getting-started#generating-client-id-and-client-secret-key)
from [Equinix Developer Platform portal](https://developer.equinix.com).

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

Example [provider configuration](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html)
in `main.tf` file:

```hcl
provider equinix {
  client_id     = "someID"
  client_secret = "someSecret"
}
```

Example provider configuration using `environment variables`:

```sh
export EQUINIX_API_CLIENTID=someID
export EQUINIX_API_CLIENTSECRET=someSecret
```

## Argument Reference

The Equinix provider requires a few basic parameters:

- `client_id` - (Required) API Consumer Key available under "My Apps" in
  developer portal. Argument can be also specified by setting `EQUINIX_API_CLIENTID`
  shell environment variable.

- `client_secret` (Required) API Consumer secret available under "My Apps" in
  developer portal. Argument can be also specified by setting `EQUINIX_API_CLIENTSECRET`
  shell environment variable.

- `endpoint` (Optional) The Equinix API base URL to point out desired environment.
   Argument can be also specified by setting `EQUINIX_API_ENDPOINT`
   shell environment variable. (Defaults to `https://api.equinix.com`)

- `request_timeout` (Optional) The duration of time, in seconds, that the
  Equinix Platform API Client should wait before canceling an API request.
  Canceled requests may still result in provisioned resources. (Defaults to `30`)

These parameters can be provided in [Terraform variable
files](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-definitions-tfvars-files)
or as environment variables. Nevertheless, please note that it is [not
recommended to keep sensitive data in plain text
